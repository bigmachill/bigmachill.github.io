<h2>Mackenzie Hill</h2>
<p>
Mackenzie Hill is a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on Lean Practices at Oakland University. She is attracted towards problems regarding efficiency that are able to reduce the largest amount of waste, especially in topics of manufacturing, visual design, or even event planning. Presently, Mackenzie is seeking to use her engineering study to reinvent modern manufacturing in a paradigm shift of scalable autonomous technologies. Additionally, she is involved in projects afterhours including graphic design, mechatronics, lean implementation, and machine learning.
